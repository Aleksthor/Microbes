# Microbes
## What is the project about?
The project is an evolution simulation. We let the agents in the enviroment 
have a neural network for a "brain". All creatures have important attributes that can mutate. 
The neural networks can also mutate.

## Some cool results
Early in the simulation we see alot of the "useless" networks die off, and only the somewhat
useful ones surive and reproduce. After some time the creatures develop different strategies
to stay alive. This simulation currently has no limit to how long you can run it,
but i would say after some time the networks do reach some "ceiling".

## Where is this project heading?

### Brain future
Currently the agents use a fully connected neural networks and this has some limitations.
I would like to implement NEAT neural networks or "Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies".
This would allow the networks themselves to reach a higher ceiling in "intelligence"

### Creatures future
Currently the creatures only eat food, and there are not enough dangers. 
Im looking to add a predator to the game, but this may prove to be a big task.
